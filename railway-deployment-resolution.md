## Railway Deployment Issue Resolution

### **The Problem**
The Railway deployment was failing with Puppeteer browser initialization errors. The logs showed:
```
Failed to initialize Puppeteer browser: Tried to find the browser at the configured path (/usr/bin/chromium), but no executable was found.
```

### **Root Cause Analysis**
The issue was **NOT** missing Chrome installation in the container. The actual problem was **environment variable misconfiguration**:

1. **Environment Variables Were Forcing Wrong Browser Path**: The `.env.example` file contained:
   ```
   PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true
   PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium
   ```

2. **This Configuration Told Puppeteer To**:
   - Skip downloading its bundled Chromium (`PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true`)
   - Use a system Chrome at `/usr/bin/chromium` that doesn't exist in Railway containers

3. **The Code Was Actually Correct**: The `rmv-monitor-service.js` file was properly configured to use `puppeteer.launch()` with bundled Chromium, but environment variables were overriding this behavior.

### **The Solution**
**Fixed by updating Railway environment variables** (not code changes):

```bash
railway variables --set "PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=false"
railway variables --set "PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH="
```

### **Why This Worked**
- `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=false` allows Puppeteer to use its bundled Chromium
- `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=""` removes the hardcoded path, letting Puppeteer auto-detect

### **Key Lesson for Claude Code**
When debugging Puppeteer deployment issues:

1. **Check environment variables FIRST** - they can override code configurations
2. **Look at `.env.example`** files to understand intended production config
3. **Railway/container environments** often work better with bundled Chromium than system Chrome
4. **Don't assume missing packages** - check if existing packages are being misconfigured

### **Alternative Solutions Considered**
- Installing Chrome via nixpacks.toml (unnecessary complexity)
- Dockerfile with Chrome installation (overkill)
- Code changes to Puppeteer configuration (not needed)

The fix was purely **environment configuration**, not code or infrastructure changes.
