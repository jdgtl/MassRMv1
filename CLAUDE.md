## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend APIs:
- **`/api/extract-personal-data`** - Fast 9.3s personal info extraction
- **`/api/scrape-rmv-appointments`** - Multi-center appointment checking
- **`/api/clear-sessions`** - Smart session management
- **Fast Scraping Engine** - 5-8s appointment discovery vs 19s+ legacy
- **Robust Error Handling** - Comprehensive try/catch with logging

### Key Methods:
- **`fastAppointmentsScraping()`** - Optimized 5-8s appointment discovery 
- **`checkRMVUrl()`** - Legacy 3-step navigation (fallback)
- **`extractPersonalData()`** - Puppeteer-based data extraction
- **`validateForm()`** - Complete input validation
- **`displayAppointments()`** - Enhanced results rendering with date grouping

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Fast Scraping Engine** - 5-8s vs 19s+ with disabled CSS/images
- **Aggressive Timeouts** - 6s navigation vs 15s+ conservative waits  
- **Smart Session Management** - Auto-clear old sessions to prevent conflicts
- **Dynamic Wait Times** - Responds to DOM changes vs fixed timeouts
- **Intelligent UI Loading** - Spinner timing matches actual processing
- **Parallel Processing** - Handles multiple locations simultaneously
- **Smart Intervals** - 5 minutes during business hours, 30 minutes off-hours

## 🚨 Latest Major Updates

### 🐛 Debug Session (September 1, 2025):
```javascript
// FIXED: Missing /api/clear-sessions endpoint (404 → 200)
// FIXED: Intermittent browser initialization failures  
// FIXED: First-attempt connection errors
// SWITCHED: From test server to full production server
```

**Root Cause Identified**: System was running `rmv-monitor-service-test.js` instead of `rmv-monitor-service.js`
- Test server lacked complete API endpoints and monitoring features
- Browser initialization timing issues on first attempts
- Missing production features like session management

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Added missing `/api/clear-sessions` endpoint to test server
- ✅ Enhanced browser initialization with 500ms delay
- ✅ Improved error handling for connection failures  
- ✅ Switched package.json to use full production server
- ✅ All intermittent connection errors now resolved

### 🚀 Performance Revolution + Calendar View (September 1, 2025):
```javascript
// Fast appointments scraping: 5-8 seconds vs 19+ seconds
// Full calendar integration with modal popups
// Fixed timezone parsing issues for correct month display
// Monitoring system now uses fast scraping method
// Clean UI with green-only highlighting for preferred appointments
```

### Previous Major Fixes:
- Parameter alignment (preferences vs userPreferences)
- Method recovery (checkRMVUrl from git backup)  
- UI state management and browser timing optimizations
