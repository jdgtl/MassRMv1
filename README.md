- **üö´ No More Errors**: Regional buttons use replacement logic - no 8-location limit conflicts
- **üîÄ Seamless Switch**: Works with both discovered and default location sets

### How It Works:
1. **Enter RMV URL** ‚Üí System navigates to your appointment page
2. **Extract Locations** ‚Üí Reads available locations for your appointment type
3. **Map to Regions** ‚Üí Assigns locations to Boston Metro, North Shore, South Shore, Central MA, Western MA, Islands
4. **Update UI** ‚Üí Regional buttons now select the correct discovered locations
5. **Smart Selection** ‚Üí Selecting a new region clears previous selections (no errors!)
