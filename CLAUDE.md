## 🚨 Latest Major Updates

### 🔒 PII-GATED PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE (September 8, 2025):
```javascript
// ✅ SECTION VISIBILITY CONTROL: Fixed premature section reveal during location discovery
// ✅ PERSONAL DATA GATING: Sections 2-7 only appear after successful personal data extraction
// ✅ SMART ERROR RECOVERY: Failed PII extraction hides all subsequent sections
// ✅ LOCATION DISCOVERY SEPARATION: Location discovery prepares data without showing UI
// ✅ PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE PATTERN: Clean UX flow ensures users only see usable functionality
```

**Root Cause Fixed:**
- **Problem**: Location discovery was calling `showSubsequentSections()` which revealed sections 3-7 prematurely
- **Issue**: Users could see service centers, time preferences, etc. even when personal data extraction failed
- **Solution**: Separated location discovery from section visibility - only personal data extraction reveals sections

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Location Discovery Success**: Only calls `hideLocationDiscoveryError()` - no sections revealed
- **Personal Data Extraction Success**: Calls `showSections()` to reveal all sections 2-7 with fade-in animation
- **Personal Data Extraction Failure**: Calls `hideSubsequentSections()` to hide all sections 2-7
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Ensures proper UX flow where functionality is only shown when usable

**Functions Updated:**
- `showSections()`: Now shows sections 2-7 (was 3-7) after personal data extraction success
- `hideSubsequentSections()`: Now hides sections 2-7 (was 3-7) on extraction failure
- Location discovery: Removed premature `showSubsequentSections()` call
- Removed unused `showSection2Only()` function for code cleanliness

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Clean UX Flow**: Users only see sections they can actually use
- ✅ **Error Prevention**: No confusion from seeing unusable sections
- ✅ **Proper Gating**: Personal information must be extracted before proceeding
- ✅ **Consistent State**: Failed extraction properly resets UI to initial state
