- **Data Extraction**: Intelligent DOM parsing with anti-detection
- **Logging**: Winston with file and console output

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Speed Optimizations:
- **9.3-second** average personal data extraction
- **Sub-second** appointment checking initiation
- **Dynamic wait times** that respond to page load states
- **Intelligent section expansion** (only expands sections with appointments)

### Reliability Features:
- **3-step navigation** for robust appointment discovery
- **Automatic error recovery** with fallback strategies
- **Browser session persistence** to avoid repeated logins
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging and monitoring

## 🔧 System Requirements

### Runtime Dependencies:
